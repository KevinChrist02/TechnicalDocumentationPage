        <p>
          Markdown is commonly used to author text-heavy content like blog posts
          and documentation. Astro includes built-in support for standard
          Markdown files that can also include frontmatter YAML to define custom
          metadata such as a title, description, and tags.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the @astrojs/mdx integration installed, Astro also supports MDX
          (.mdx) files which bring added features like support for JavaScript
          expressions and components in your Markdown content.
        </p>
        <p>Use either or both types of files to write your Markdown content!</p>
